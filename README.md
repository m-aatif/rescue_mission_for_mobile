# ü§ñ Mobile Robot Rescue Mission ‚Äì Path Planning Application
This project is a **Flutter-based application** for **map-based path planning** with obstacle avoidance. It allows users to define a **working area**, **start point**, **goal point**, and **obstacles**, then runs a path planning algorithm to compute an efficient route.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Custom Map Selection**  
  - Select or create a map based on the real world.  
  - Save maps for later use.  

- **Define Environment**  
  - Set the **working area**.  
  - Define the **start position** and **end (goal) position**.  
  - Add **obstacles** to the map.  

- **Path Planning Algorithm**  
  - Computes a path from the start to the goal point while avoiding obstacles.  
  - Uses **cellular decomposition** to divide the map into smaller regions (cells).  
  - Finds the path through **cell centers** for efficient navigation.  

- **Dynamic Ground-Based Path Planning**  
  - Once a path is calculated between cell centers, it is **stored in memory**.  
  - Future queries for the same cell-to-cell paths are **retrieved directly** instead of recalculated.  
  - Significantly improves **time efficiency** for repeated computations.

## üöÄ How It Works

1. Select or create a **map**.  
2. Define:  
   - Working area  
   - Obstacles  
   - Start point  
   - Goal point  
3. The application:  
   - Divides the map into **cells** (cellular decomposition).  
   - Computes the optimal path via **cell centers**.  
   - Stores computed cell-to-cell paths for future reuse.  
4. Retrieve paths efficiently in future runs without recalculating.
